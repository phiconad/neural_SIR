# neural_SIR
Repo for coupling Neural Nets and SIR models.
Extension of state space modelling of comparmental models to forecast and evaluate policies, as in "An Epidemiological Modelling Approach for Covid19 via Data Assimilation" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12130).

The main file is coupled_SIR.py.
Auxiliary files SIR_cov.py and SIR.py model the robust covariances and dynamic SIR separately.
